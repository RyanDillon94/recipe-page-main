## Overview

- This one was great for practicing Padding and Margins. Haven't used lists and tables in a while so that was fun!

## My process

- Started with the basic HTML structure.
- Developed the basic CSS, starting with browser view.
- Styled the image, then the colouring of the H1s and H2s, then the lists, finishing with the table.
- Once i had the basic build matching the designs, i began to work on the finer details, such as finishing padding/margins.
- Moved onto media query for the mobile view

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- VS Code

### What I learned

- Tables are difficult to style! Without the Dev tools i would have stuggled.
- Used the Dev tools quite a lot with this one.

### Continued development

- Need to work on tables and lists more!
- Started to use em and rem on this one, great when it came to scalling down for mobile view! Will keep this up!
